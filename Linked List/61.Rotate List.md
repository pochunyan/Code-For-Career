###### Problem
Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

###### Thinking
1. corner case,
	1. if head is null or head.next is null, return head right away
2. Using while loop to count length, connect and make it into circular list and also make the pointers point to the tail and head.
3. counting real step need to rotate, mod with lengh. And minus with total length, and then get how many steps to move
4. use for loop to rotate give,
	1. each iteration move tail to next and head to next
5. after for loop is done,
	1. tail.next = null
6. returm it

###### Solution
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // corner case
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        
        // count length, connect to a circle and also keep pointer point to head and head.prev
        int len = 1;
        ListNode cur = head;
        ListNode tail = null;
        while (cur.next != null) {
            cur = cur.next;
            len++;
        }
        tail = cur;
        cur.next = head;
        cur = head;
        // rotate steps
        int step = len - (Math.abs(k) % len);
        
        // rotate
        for (int i = 0; i < step; i++) {
            tail = tail.next;
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        tail.next = null;
        return cur;
    }
}
```
