#### Problem

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```
---

#### Thinking
1. corner case: 
	1. if l1 && l2 both are null return null
	2. if l1 is null return l2
	3. if l2 is null return l1
2. Create a new ListNode for linking sorted list
3. Create another ListNode to store the head of the ListNode just created, for return the head as answer
3. Declare two pointers, each point to the head of the list l1 & l2
4. while loop condition if pointer1 & pointer2 is not null
	1. if value that pointer1 points is small or equal to the value pointers points, new list links it, and pointer1 move forward
	2. otherwise links the node pointer2 points, and pointer2 move forward
	3. each iteration new list node move to next as well
5. After the while loop, check which pointer points to the null, and link the rest of it.
6. return the answer


#### Solution
```
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode cur1 = l1;
        ListNode cur2 = l2;
        ListNode ans = new ListNode(-1);
        ListNode ansHead = ans;
        while (cur1 != null && cur2 != null) {
            if (cur1.val <= cur2.val) {
                ans.next = cur1;
                cur1 = cur1.next;
            }else {
                ans.next = cur2;
                cur2 = cur2.next;
            }
            ans = ans.next;
        }
        if (cur1 != null) {
            ans.next = cur1;
        }
        if (cur2 != null) {
            ans.next = cur2;
        }
        return ansHead.next;
    }
}
```
#### Time/Space Complexity

Time: O(n) Space: O(1)
