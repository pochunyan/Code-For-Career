###### Problem

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

###### Thinking

1. Declare a hashtable, key & value will be value & index
2. loop through all the elements
    1. in each iteration, get the value of the element and target minus that value to get the rest
    2. check if the rest is contained in the hashtable
        1. if it is not continue iteration
        2. if it is, return the answer pair

###### Solution

```
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> hashTable = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int rest = target - nums[i];
            if (hashTable.containsKey(rest)) return new int[] {hashTable.get(rest), i};
            hashTable.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return new int[]{};
    }
}
```
