###### Problem

Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```


* You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
* Minimize the total number of operations.

###### Thinking 

1. Declare two pointers, one will keep iterating, while the other only move after swapping
2. the pointer encounter the non-zero element will swap
3. Hence, after the swap, non-zero element will be swtich to the front and the zero element will keep move back

###### Solution

```
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < nums.length;) {
            if (nums[k] != 0) {
                int tmp = nums[k];
                nums[k] = nums[i];
                nums[i] = tmp;
                i++;
            }
            k++;
        }
    }
}
```
