###### Problem

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

###### Thinking

1. Declare two arrays
	* One is looking from left to right, the max height water can reach after hit the wall
	* One is looking from right to left, the max height water can reach after hit the wall

2. Since we get the two arrays, we can use this two arrays to get the available water can sustain
	* Math.min(fromLeft[i], fromRight[i])
3. Finally, we use the final array get from step 2 to minus original array(the wall).
4. Add up the water amount and return

###### Solution

```
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int[] fromLeft = new int[height.length];
        int[] fromRight = new int[height.length];
        int maxHeight = height[0];
        fromLeft[0] = maxHeight;
        for (int i = 1; i < height.length; i++) {
            if (height[i] > maxHeight) {
                fromLeft[i] = height[i];
                maxHeight = height[i];
            } else {
                fromLeft[i] = maxHeight;
            }
        }
        
        maxHeight = height[height.length - 1];
        fromRight[height.length - 1] = maxHeight;
        for (int i = height.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (height[i] > maxHeight) {
                fromRight[i] = height[i];
                maxHeight = fromRight[i];
            } else {
                fromRight[i] = maxHeight;
            }
            fromRight[i] = Math.min(fromRight[i], fromLeft[i]);
        }
        int water = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < height.length; i++) {
            water += (fromRight[i] - height[i]);
        }
        return water;
    }
}
```
