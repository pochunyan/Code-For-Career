###### Problem
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all test cases.

```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

###### Thinking 

1. Corner case: if s.length() is 0, which means s is empty then always true
2. Delcare two pointers i for s, j for t
	* once the char match, i & j both move forward, otherwise only j move
	* When i or j is larger than their corresponding string, then break the loop
3. if after break the loop, i is equal to the length of s, means it is successfully matched the condition of being subsequence of the t -> return true, othrewise return false.

###### Solution
```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() == 0) return true;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (j < t.length() && i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return i == s.length();
    }
}
```
